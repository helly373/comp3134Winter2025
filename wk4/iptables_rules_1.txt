NAME
       iptables/ip6tables — administration tool for IPv4/IPv6 packet filtering and NAT

SYNOPSIS
       iptables [-t table] {-A|-C|-D} chain rule-specification

       ip6tables [-t table] {-A|-C|-D} chain rule-specification

       iptables [-t table] -I chain [rulenum] rule-specification

       iptables [-t table] -R chain rulenum rule-specification

       iptables [-t table] -D chain rulenum

       iptables [-t table] -S [chain [rulenum]]

       iptables [-t table] {-F|-L|-Z} [chain [rulenum]] [options...]

       iptables [-t table] -N chain

       iptables [-t table] -X [chain]

       iptables [-t table] -P chain target

       iptables [-t table] -E old-chain-name new-chain-name

       rule-specification = [matches...] [target]

       match = -m matchname [per-match-options]

       target = -j targetname [per-target-options]

DESCRIPTION
       Iptables  and ip6tables are used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv4 and IPv6
       packet filter rules in the Linux kernel.  Several different tables may be defined.  Each  ta‐
       ble contains a number of built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains.

       Each  chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets.  Each rule specifies what to
       do with a packet that matches.  This is called a `target', which may be a jump to a  user-de‐
       fined chain in the same table.

TARGETS
       A  firewall rule specifies criteria for a packet and a target.  If the packet does not match,
       the next rule in the chain is examined; if it does match, then the next rule is specified  by
       the  value  of  the target, which can be the name of a user-defined chain, one of the targets
       described in iptables-extensions(8), or one of the special values ACCEPT, DROP or RETURN.

       ACCEPT means to let the packet through.  DROP means to drop the packet on the floor.   RETURN
       means stop traversing this chain and resume at the next rule in the previous (calling) chain.
       If the end of a built-in chain is reached or a rule in a built-in chain with target RETURN is
       matched, the target specified by the chain policy determines the fate of the packet.

TABLES
       There  are currently five independent tables (which tables are present at any time depends on
