Difference Between strip_tags and html_entity Conversion:

1. strip_tags:
   - Removes all HTML and PHP tags from the input.
   - If a user inputs <script>alert('hello')</script>, the output becomes "alert('hello')".
   - It is a simple method to eliminate any HTML code but may remove useful formatting.

2. html_entity Conversion (using functions like htmlspecialchars):
   - Converts special characters (<, >, &, ', ") to their corresponding HTML entities.
   - For the same input, <script>alert('hello')</script> is displayed as
     "&lt;script&gt;alert(&#039;hello&#039;)&lt;/script&gt;".
   - The tags remain visible as text but are rendered safe since they are not executed as HTML/JavaScript.

Overall, while both methods prevent execution of malicious scripts, strip_tags removes the tags entirely while html_entity conversion preserves the input in a safe, displayable format.
